# A try on Lisp by C++

inspired by these guys below:
- https://norvig.com/lispy.html
- https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter
- https://github.com/klmr/lisp.cpp

TODO:
- support string and  :ballot_box_with_check:
- support lambda :ballot_box_with_check:
- or refactor with so called "modern C++"?

Compile:

$ `g++ main.cpp -g -Wall -std=c++11 -o main`
